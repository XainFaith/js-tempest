# js-tempest
 Javascript Json Component Composition Factory Lib
 
 The purpose of tempest is to allow for fast prototyping of game objects by defining there properties and the components they are composed of in a json file as blue prints.
 
 
 Example.html shows an example of how objectFactory.js can be used.
 data/objects.json is the blue print json file.
 
 The object blue print system supports inheriting blue prints as well as overriding values on inherited blue prints.
 
 If you happen to use this for anything please let me know id be curious to see how it gets used.
